# Recommendation-System

This movie recommendation system makes use of Netflix dataset sourced from Kaggle, employing various stages including data cleansing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning methodologies to generate movie suggestions tailored to individual user preferences. 

Developed in Python, the system capitalizes on libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for efficient data manipulation, while Matplotlib aids in visually representing the data. Machine learning techniques, notably K-means Clustering and Sklearn with TF-IDF Word Vectorizer and Cosine Similarities, are instrumental in the analysis process. 

Through data cleansing, noisy or irrelevant data is removed to enhance the accuracy of recommendations. EDA allows for a deeper understanding of the dataset's characteristics, enabling more informed decisions during the recommendation process. The utilization of machine learning techniques facilitates the identification of patterns and correlations within the data, leading to more personalized and accurate movie suggestions.

Overall, this Python-based project integrates multiple tools and methodologies to create a robust and effective movie recommendation system.
